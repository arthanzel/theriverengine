- Fish consumption radius
- Energy
- Reproduction
- Swim speed

Winter break 
============

## Movement
- Sharks
- Random
- Tie swim speed to nutrient density env - emergent behaviour to high-density areas
- Immigration / emigration
    - Discourage fish from moving to termini
    - Monitor emigration and compensate?

## GMO
- Will hungry GMO fish die at the same rate or have higher fitness?

# Food
- Tie death rate to nutrient uptake - game of life? Neat experiment to do.

# Reproduction and lifecycle
- Age property - no juveniles nor age in null model
- Tie energy to reproductive success, but in what way?

## Documentation

Null model MUST contain movement, food, reproduction

1st priority: close the cycle and get a null model
